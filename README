Twapake can be usefull when:
----------------------------
    - making a daily snapshot with the help of a cron job.
      If you are getting into troubles, it will be easy to see which new
      packages have been installed since time T.
    - you like testing a lot off packages, some of them making you install
      a bunch of extra libs.
      You can print a twapake snapshot before your testing party and after.
      The diff will give you the list of what you have to remove to
      retrieve a clean system.
    - you want to see what are the last 5 installed packages.
    - you want to remove the last 6 installed packages.
